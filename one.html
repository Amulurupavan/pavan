<h3><u>Development</h3></u></h2><br/>
<h4><p> In mid August 2020, it was reported that Prabhas and Prashanth Neel were to collaborate for the latter's next directional after KGF: Chapter 2 (2022). The former was reportedly impressed with the latter's debut film Ugramm (2014) and wanted to make a film in the genre.[8] Prashanth, during a media interaction in mid October, confirmed the collaboration between the two.[9] On 2 December, the project was publicly announced by Hombale Films, who are funding the project.[10] Touted to be an action thriller, the film marks the first collaboration between director Prashanth Neel and Prabhas, and the first Telugu venture of Neel. On his role, Prabhas stated: "My character is extremely violent, so this is something I haven’t really done before."[11] A few reports claimed that the film is a remake of Neel's debut film Ugramm, however, Neel clarified that Salaar is not a remake but an original story written for Prabhas.</p><hr>
